- 👋 Hi, I’m @Egg-Of-Glory999
- 👀 I’m interested in just making stuff
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make an OS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Windows 8.12 Crying Edition (an obvious joke)
- 📫 How to reach me: jcogbill486@gmail.com
I am 13 years old, and I like to code.
Right now, I am looking for people to help me out with my joke project.
All of my projects (including Windows 8.12 CE) are open source, no big surprise.
